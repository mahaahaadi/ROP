              The things out there that are unknown aren't scary in themselves.
              They are just unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them
              before you list them as scary. Then the world will be a much less
              scary place for you. Do you think you're living an ordinary life?
              You are so mistaken it's difficult to even explain. The mere fact
              that you exist makes you extraordinary. The odds of you existing
              are less than winning the lottery, but here you are. Are you going
              to let this extraordinary opportunity pass? The desert wind blew
              the tumbleweed in front of the car. Alex swerved to avoid the
              tumbleweed. But he turned the wheel a bit too strong and the car
              left the road and skidded onto the dirt median. He instantly
              slammed on the brakes and the car stopped in a cloud of dirt. When
              the dust cloud had settled and he could see around him again, he
              realized that he'd somehow crossed over into an entirely new
              dimension. The bush began to shake. Brad couldn't see what was
              causing it to shake, but he didn't care. he had a pretty good idea
              about what was going on and what was happening. He was so
              confident that he approached the bush carefree and with a smile on
              his face. That all changed the instant he realized what was
              actually behind the bush. The wave roared towards them with speed
              and violence they had not anticipated.
              
              Something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree
              leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway. No matter how hard
              he tried, he couldn't give her a good explanation about what had
              happened. It didn't even really make sense to him. All he knew was
              that he froze at the moment and no matter how hard he tried to
              react, nothing in his body allowed him to move. It was as if he
              had instantly become a statue and although he could see what was
              taking place, he couldn't move to intervene. He knew that wasn't a
              satisfactory explanation even though it was the truth. He couldn't
              remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he
              had. The fact that she didn't believe him was quite frustrating as
              he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn't as
              if it was something that seemed impossible. Yet she insisted on
              always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact. She tried not
              to judge him. His ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look
              homeless. Was he really the next Einstein as she had been told? On
              the off chance it.

                They both turned to run but by that time it was too late. The
                wave crashed into their legs sweeping both of them off of their
                feet. They now found themselves in a washing machine of
                saltwater, getting tumbled and not know what was up or down.
                Both were scared, not knowing how this was going to end, but it
                was by far the best time of the trip thus far. The trail to the
                left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the
                trail to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his
                hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as an
                invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and
                exciting. As the others in the group all shited to the right,
                Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would
                later regret. "It's never good to give them details," Janice
                told her sister. "Always be a little vague and keep them
                guessing." Her sister listened intently and nodded in agreement.
                She didn't fully understand what her sister was saying but that
                didn't matter. She loved her so much that she would have agreed
                to whatever came out of her mouth. The words hadn't flowed from
                his fingers for the past few weeks. He never imagined he'd find
                himself with writer's block, but here he sat with a blank screen
                in front of him. That blank screen taunting him day after day
                had started to play with his mind. He didn't understand why he
                couldn't even type a single word, just one to begin the process
                and build from there. And yet, he already knew that the eight
                hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today
                would end with the screen remaining blank. Green vines attached
                to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of
                the canopy. Ants used the vine as their private highway,
                avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, to freely move
                at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on
                their current chore. At least this was the way it was supposed
                to be.
